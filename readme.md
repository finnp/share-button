Share
=====
Simple, light, flexible, and good-looking share button jquery plugin. Ermahgerd. [See it in action here](http://sharebutton.co/).

<p align="center"><a><img src="http://cl.ly/Ti66/prev.jpg" /></a></p>


```js
new Share(".share-button", {
  network: {
    facebook: {
      app_id: "abc123"
    }
  }
});
```

### Why Should You Use This?

All the major social networks have their own share buttons you can put on your page, but doing it like this sucks for a lot of reasons:

1. They are slow-loading, and inject a lot of extra javascript onto your page that's not needed which makes your page slower.
2. They don't look sexy and fit nicely with your site like you want, and you can't change how they look.
3. Every time you need them, you have to google 'twitter share button' and 'facebook like button' and such and go through their interface and copy and paste code and this is repetitive and stupid. It also takes up a ton of space and looks messy in your code.
4. The buttons themselves take up a lot of space (especially the facebook like button).

Let's take a quick look at the alternative, using this little js plugin:

1. It doesn't load any iframes or extra javascript and overall load time is tons faster.
2. It looks simple and clean by default, and can be customized in any and every way.
3. All you have to do to use it is include the script and call `new Share` on an empty div. That's two lines of code total, the script link and the share call.
4. It's tiny and compact, expanding only when the user actually wants to share something.

### Setup

1. [Download the script](https://github.com/carrot/share-button/releases/download/v0.0.6/share.min.js) and include it on your page.
2. Make an empty div on your page
3. In your javascript, call `new Share('.element')`
4. Pass options to the share call if you want (details below)
5. Profit!

### All Options

You can pass an options object when you call `Share` on an element to make things a little more flexible.

```js
config = {
  protocol: // the protocol you'd prefer to use. [Default: your current protocol]
  url: // the url you'd like to share. [Default: `window.location.href`]
  title: // title to be shared alongside your link [Default: your page's meta description]
  text: // text to be shared alongside your link, [Default: your page's meta description]   
  image: // image to be shared [Default: your page's meta description]
  ui: {
    flyout: // change the flyout direction of the shares. chose from `top left`, `top center`, `top right`, `bottom left`, `bottom right`, or `bottom center` [Default: `top center`]
    button_font: // include the Lato font set from the Google Fonts API. [Default: `true`]
    button_text: // change the text of the button, [Default: `Share`]
    button_icon: // change the icon to the left. choose from http://weloveiconfonts.com/#entypo) [Default: 'export']
    button_background: // background color of the button [Default: #e1e1e1]
    button_color: // text color of the button, [Default: #333]  
  },
  network: {
    google_plus: {
      enabled: // Enable Google+. [Default: true] (not yet implemented)
      url: // the url you'd like to share to Google+ [Default: config.url]
    },
    twitter: {
      enabled: // Enable Twitter. [Default: true] (not yet implemented)
      url: // the url you'd like to share to Twitter [Default: config.url]
      text: // text to be shared alongside your link to Twitter [Default: config.text]
    },
    facebook: {
      enabled: // Enable Facebook. [Default: true] (not fully implemented)
      url: // the url you'd like to share to Facebook [Default: config.url]
      app_id: // Facebook app id for tracking shares. if provided, will use the facebook API
      title: // title to be shared alongside your link to Facebook [Default: config.title]
      caption: // caption to be shared alongside your link to Facebook [Default: null]
      text: // text to be shared alongside your link to Facebook [Default: config.text]
      image: // image to be shared to Facebook [Default: config.image]
    }
  }
}
```

### Network Filter Options

```js
config = {
  network: {
    facebook: {
      before: function() {
        this.url   = "https://github.com/carrot/share-button";
        this.text  = "Changing the Facebook Share Configurations";
        return this
      },
      after: function() {
        console.log("User shared:", this.url);
      }
    }
  }
}
```



**Example:**

```js
new Share(".share-button-top", {
  title: "Share Button",
  network: {
    facebook: {
      app_id: "602752456409826",
      before: function() {
        console.log("BEFORE", this);
        this.url   = "https://github.com/carrot/share-button";
        this.text  = "Changing the Facebook Share Configurations";
        return this
      },
      after: function() {
        console.log("User shared:", this.url);
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Public API

The share button also returns a small api that can be used to control it down the line if you need to. Example shown below:

```js
var share = $('.el').share();

share.toggle(); // toggles the share button popup
share.open();   // open the share button popup
share.close();  // closes the share button popup
share.options;  // exposes the options listed above, can not currently be changed interactively
share.self;     // returns an instance of the jquery object it was called on (for chaining)

```

This will likely become more powerful down the line as this project continues to be developed - open an issue if there's anything you wish the api would have.
